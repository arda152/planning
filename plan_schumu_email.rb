# TIMESLOT DATABASE

# Time slots for the whole week, manually written to be flexible with different opening hours, they contain:
# => duration : the duration of the practice slot, in hours
# => slot_name: the name of the day and the time slot
# => available_rooms: all of the room names that are available in this time slot (empty in the beginning)
# => slot_score: capacity - requests to practice in the room. Used later in the algorithm.

# PLANNING ALGORITHM

# The program goes through all time slots
# Each room is given to the free student who has the least total reserved hours until that moment
# This makes sure everything stays equal

# The only condition: the algorithm needs to have rooms with lots of competition (negative slot score) at the end
# These rooms with lots of competition are used to equal out students with less practice time
# Since the slot score is very low, we know that many students can come at these time slots, so equalizing becomes easy
# In the same way, using the rooms with positive slot score (lots of free space, no competition) will be helpful
# Giving priority to these zero competition rooms makes sure that we actually find the people who wanted to practice there
# This also makes sure that zero competition rooms are given as soon as possible, otherwise they can remain too empty


# Order the timeslots with decreasing score. Rooms that have lots of free space will be given first
